UNGOVERNABLE

To work is to express yourself through the exercise of your intellect and the exercise of your body; your body is your first property, and whatever is created through the exercise of this first property is your property too; no one has a right to the product of your work.
If I offer you the exercise of my intellect, it is because I wanted to and not because I was coerced.
