Gênesis 8:11

Do you want more protests in favor of free speech, freedom of software and freedom of work similar to this one?

This client nostr is a demonstration of a fraction of my power, as I have no funding other than my goodwill, with a contribution in satoshis you help me fund other products.

There's still a lot of work to do.
